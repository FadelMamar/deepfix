# DeepSight Advisor - Global Orchestrator Plan

## Overview

The DeepSight Advisor is a global orchestrator that automates the complete ML analysis pipeline: from artifact loading to intelligent query generation and execution. It serves as a unified interface for running comprehensive ML analysis workflows with minimal configuration.


This fix ensures that the example usage scripts provide proper visibility into the advisor's execution process, making debugging and monitoring much easier for users.

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Medium Priority)
**Goal**: Enhanced functionality and user experience

#### 3.1 Batch Processing
- [ ] Implement `run_batch_analysis()` for multiple run IDs
- [ ] Add parallel processing capabilities
- [ ] Implement batch result aggregation
- [ ] Add progress tracking for batch operations

#### 3.2 Custom Prompt Builders
- [ ] Design extensible prompt builder system
- [ ] Implement custom builder registration
- [ ] Add builder validation and testing
- [ ] Create example custom builders

#### 3.3 Template System
- [ ] Implement predefined analysis templates
- [ ] Add template loading and customization
- [ ] Create common analysis scenarios (comprehensive, performance-focused, data-quality-focused)
- [ ] Add template validation and documentation

### Phase 4: Optimization & Polish (Low Priority)
**Goal**: Performance optimization and user experience improvements

#### 4.1 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement intelligent caching strategies
- [ ] Add async processing where beneficial
- [ ] Optimize memory usage for large artifacts
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and metrics

#### 4.2 Result Comparison & Analysis
- [ ] Implement cross-run result comparison
- [ ] Add trend analysis capabilities
- [ ] Create visualization support for results
- [ ] Add statistical analysis of multiple runs

#### 4.3 Documentation & Examples
- [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Add usage examples and tutorials
- [ ] Create configuration templates and examples
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guides

### Phase 5: CLI Interface (Future)
**Goal**: Command-line interface for easy usage

#### 5.1 CLI Framework
- [ ] Implement CLI using Click or similar framework
- [ ] Add command-line argument parsing
- [ ] Implement configuration file support
- [ ] Add help and usage documentation

#### 5.2 CLI Features
- [ ] Add interactive mode for configuration
- [ ] Implement progress bars and status updates
- [ ] Add output formatting options
- [ ] Create CLI-specific error handling

### Implementation Notes

#### Dependencies
- **Phase 1**: Core DeepSight components (already available)
- **Phase 2**: Intelligence client components (already available)
- **Phase 3**: Additional utility libraries for batch processing
- **Phase 4**: Performance monitoring libraries
- **Phase 5**: CLI framework (Click, Typer, or similar)

#### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Each component tested independently
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing
- **Configuration Tests**: YAML loading and validation
- **Error Handling Tests**: Comprehensive error scenario coverage
- **Performance Tests**: Memory and execution time benchmarks

#### File Structure
```
src/deepsight/core/advisor/
├── __init__.py
├── config.py          # Configuration classes
├── orchestrator.py    # Main DeepSightAdvisor class
├── result.py          # AdvisorResult and related classes
├── errors.py          # Error hierarchy
```

#### Success Criteria
- **Phase 1**: Can load artifacts and generate queries from YAML config
- **Phase 2**: Complete analysis pipeline with AI execution and result saving
- **Phase 3**: Batch processing and extensible prompt builders
- **Phase 4**: Optimized performance and comprehensive documentation
- **Phase 5**: Full CLI interface with interactive features

This phased approach ensures we build a solid foundation first, then add advanced features incrementally while maintaining code quality and user experience.
